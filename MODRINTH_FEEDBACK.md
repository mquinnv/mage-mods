we received the following feedback from modrinth moderation:

Modrinth does not support uploading multiple variations of your project as separate versions.
New Versions of your project should strictly be a linear upgrade of the same content.
Having alternate versions of your content on the same project will hurt the functionality of the Modrinth App and other supported launchers as it would prevent users from updating your content, and may make it harder for your users to find the content they want.
We ask that you upload each alternate version of your project as a new project, ensuring that all users will be able to access and easily find your content.

Insufficient Summary
Per section 5.3 of Modrinth's Content Rules your Summary can not include any extra formatting such as lists, or links. Your project summary should provide a brief overview of your project that informs and entices users.

This is the first thing most people will see about your mod other than the Logo, so it's important it be accurate, reasonably detailed, and exciting.

Private Server
Under normal circumstances, your project would be rejected due to the issues listed above. However, since your project is intended for a specific server and not for general use, these requirements will be waived and your project will be withheld. This means it will be unlisted and accessible only through a direct link, without appearing in public search results. If you're fine with this, no further action is needed. Otherwise, feel free to resubmit once all issues have been addressed.
