## Security Memories
- Remember that we have a Bearer token in .env for the Mondrith API
- Remember to use the modrinth API with the PAT in our .env to search for mods, because it returns rich json about the dependencies and available versions of these mods
- Remember that you don't need to confirm usage of the modrinth API via curl

## Deployment Memories
- Remember that we have deployment scripts for apex hosting and also scripts to upload versions to modrinth
